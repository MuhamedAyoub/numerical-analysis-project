# Double Pendulum Simulation
 Double pendulum simulation project. It includes clear explanations of the code and visualizations to showcase the simulation results.

### 1. Introduction:

Briefly describe the double pendulum system and its significance.
Mention the different numerical methods used for simulation (RK4, RK2, Euler, TaylorP).
### 2. Code Structure:

Explain the organization of the code, including functions for different tasks.
Briefly describe the key aspects of each function without excessive code snippets.
### 3. Mathematical Equations:

Present the governing equations for the double pendulum using clear LaTeX formatting.
Briefly explain the physical meaning of each term in the equations.
### 4. Numerical Methods:

Provide a concise overview of each numerical method used (RK4, RK2, Euler, TaylorP).
Highlight the key differences and advantages/disadvantages of each method.
Include pseudocode or a basic explanation of how each method works.
### 5. Simulation Parameters:

Define the values of parameters used in the simulation, such as masses, lengths, initial conditions, etc.
Explain the reasoning behind these choices and how they might affect the behavior.
### 6. Animation:

Describe the approach used to create the animation (Matplotlib, animation library).
Explain how the animation visualizes the pendulum motion and trajectory.
### 7. Results:

Present visualizations of the simulated pendulum motion for each method.
Discuss the differences observed between the results from different methods.
Explain the limitations of each method and potential issues with accuracy.
